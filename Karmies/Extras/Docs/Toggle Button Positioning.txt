After creating the instance of KarmiesController class you can get keyboard toggle button as read-only property:

UIButton* toggleButton = karmiesController.keyboardToggleButton;

Then you can position it as the usual view:
just add it as subview to the any view you want. It perfectly works with constraints too.

If you want to place it right on the your UITextView you need to setup textContainerInset property of your UITextView:

let textInsets = textView.textContainerInset
textView.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: textInsets.top, left: textInsets.left + toggleButton.bounds.size.width, bottom: textInsets.bottom, right: textInsets.right)

Also there is the method KarmiesUtils.placeButton:onLeftOfTextView:withPlaceholderView:inSuperview that you can use for simple integration.
